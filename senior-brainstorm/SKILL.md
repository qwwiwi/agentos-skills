# Senior Brainstorm v6

## Scope

Architecture design for any software project: stack selection, feature brainstorm,
decision review, AI/LLM integration, agent-native system design.

## Non-goals

- Simple CRUD without architectural questions
- Single-framework questions without product context

## Decision Framework

Every decision passes through this filter:

1. **Stage** -- MVP, growth, scale, enterprise
2. **Team** -- 1-3, 4-10, 10+
3. **Budget** -- bootstrap, funded, enterprise
4. **Time-to-market** -- week, month, quarter
5. **Compliance** -- none, GDPR, SOC 2, PCI DSS, FERPA, COPPA

### Compliance Quick Reference

| Standard | Scope | Key Requirements | Trigger |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| GDPR | EU users' personal data | Consent, right to erasure, DPA, breach notification 72h | Any EU user |
| SOC 2 | Service org controls | Trust principles (security, availability, etc.), annual audit | Enterprise clients |
| PCI DSS | Payment card data | Tokenization, network segmentation, quarterly scans | Direct card processing |
| FERPA | US student education records | Consent transfers at 18 OR postsecondary enrollment; directory info opt-out; audit trail | K-12 or university data |
| COPPA | US children <13 | Verifiable parental consent (schools can consent in educational contexts); data minimization; no behavioral ads; operator carries compliance responsibility | Users under 13 |
| 152-ФЗ | Personal data of RU citizens | Data localization: record/store RU citizens' personal data in a database physically located in Russia; use RU hosting (Timeweb Cloud / Yandex Cloud / VK Cloud / Selectel) | Any RU users whose personal data you collect |

**FERPA notes:** Rights transfer to the student at age 18 OR upon enrollment in
postsecondary education (whichever comes first), not solely based on age. Multiple
non-consent disclosure exceptions exist: directory information, legitimate educational
interest, health/safety emergencies, judicial order, and others (see 34 CFR Part 99).

**152-ФЗ notes:** RU data-localization (242-ФЗ amendment to 152-ФЗ, art. 18 part 5)
requires that the primary database recording RU citizens' personal data sits on servers
in Russia. Mixed audiences can split storage: RU-citizen personal data on RU servers,
the rest elsewhere. This is a practical engineering note, not legal advice.

**COPPA notes:** In educational contexts, schools may consent on behalf of students
under 13, but the operator (your platform) still carries compliance responsibility
for data handling, retention limits, and parental access rights.

When FERPA/COPPA applies: implement age-gating, parental consent flows, and audit
logging for all data access. Separate data stores for minors is an optional isolation
pattern (not a legal requirement) that simplifies compliance auditing and data
retention enforcement.

## Project Archetypes

The project-type entry point. Pick the archetype first, then refine with the Default
Stack tracks below. This section is concise on purpose — it answers "what kind of thing
am I building, and what stack does it want?"

**Two axes to check first:**

1. **Does a search engine need the content?**
   - **Public** (must be indexed) → **SSG/SSR**.
   - **Behind login** (private app) → **CSR is fine** (simpler/cheaper, no SSR plumbing).
   - Note: **Yandex renders JS much worse than Google**. For a RU audience, public pages
     must be **SSG/SSR, never pure CSR** — Yandex will not see CSR-rendered content reliably.

2. **Are you coding with an AI agent?** → prefer **TypeScript + Zod + popular, conventional
   tools**. Convention and types are rails for the agent: fewer hallucinations, easier review.

### Archetype → stack

| Archetype | Rendering | Stack | Hosting / Backend |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Портал / блог** (SEO-контент) | SSG | **Astro** | Cloudflare Pages. No backend. |
| **Лендинг** (продающий) | SSG | **Astro** or plain **HTML + Tailwind** | Cloudflare Pages. |
| **Платформа с личным кабинетом** | CSR (app behind login); SSR only for public pages | **React + Vite** (CSR), or **TanStack Start** if you need SSR for public pages. Data via **TanStack Query**, forms via **TanStack Form** | **Self-host Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + auto REST/Realtime + RLS) + thin **Hono + Bun** layer for business logic RLS can't express. |
| **Telegram-бот** | n/a | **Bun + grammY** (TS, one language with the web stack) or **Python + aiogram** (closer to AI/data) | Data in Supabase / Postgres. |

For content/SEO sites, **Astro is the recommended SSG choice** (it ships zero JS by
default and indexes cleanly, including on Yandex). Where the Default Stack tracks below
mention "Vite SSG / Next.js" for static content, prefer Astro for content/SEO.

## Default Principles

- Start simple -- modular monolith, not microservices
- Optimize for reversibility -- easy to roll back decisions
- Avoid premature distribution -- do not split until it hurts
- Measure before scaling -- data, not intuition

## Agent Native Architecture (Core Principle)

**Every system must be agent-first: if an agent cannot operate it programmatically,
the architecture is wrong.**

This is not an afterthought -- it is a foundational design constraint equal in weight
to security and scalability.

### Principles

1. **Backend is for agents. Frontend is for humans.** Agents interact through APIs,
   tools, MCP -- never through UI. No feature should exist only behind a browser.
2. **API-first design.** Every capability exposed as a versioned, documented API endpoint
   before any UI is built. OpenAPI spec is the contract.
3. **MCP server integration (recommended).** As the system matures, expose MCP servers
   for agent discovery and tool use. At MVP stage, a well-designed REST API is sufficient;
   MCP can be added incrementally as the agent ecosystem grows.
4. **CLI tooling.** Every admin/ops action available as a CLI command. If you need a
   dashboard to do it, the architecture is incomplete.
5. **Webhook-driven workflows.** Events flow through webhooks/event bus, not polling.
   Agents subscribe to events and react autonomously.
6. **Programmatic admin interfaces.** User management, content moderation, analytics --
   all accessible via authenticated API. Admin panels are convenience layers, not gates.

### Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Anti-pattern |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| API-first | OpenAPI spec -> codegen -> UI | UI-first, API bolted on |
| MCP integration | MCP server per bounded context | Monolithic API with no discovery |
| Event-driven | Webhooks + event bus (NATS, Redis Streams) | Polling loops, cron-based sync |
| CLI admin | Click/Typer CLI wrapping same service layer | Admin-only web panel |
| Auth for agents | API keys + scoped tokens (not session cookies) | OAuth browser flow only |
| Observability | Structured logs + trace IDs queryable via API | Dashboard-only metrics |

### Checklist (Gate: before approving any architecture)

- [ ] Can an agent create a user without a browser?
- [ ] Can an agent publish/unpublish content via API?
- [ ] Can an agent query analytics programmatically?
- [ ] Can an agent trigger payments/refunds via API?
- [ ] Are all admin actions available without UI?
- [ ] Does the system expose MCP server(s)? (recommended, not required at MVP)
- [ ] Are events published to a webhook/event bus?

## Default Stack for New Projects (Opinionated)

For **greenfield** projects without legacy stack, start with opinionated defaults rather than open-ended stack selection. This reduces decision fatigue and produces consistent, maintainable systems.

**Three default tracks — choose by team strength, SEO/SSR requirement, and AI/data-heaviness:**

### Track A: YY Default (non-SSR projects)

Use for internal dashboards, admin panels, SPAs, mobile apps, desktop apps, bot control panels, APIs.

- Backend: **TypeScript + Hono + Bun**
- Frontend (SPA): **Client React + Vite 8** (no SSR, no Next.js)
- Frontend (static): **Vite 8 SSG** for app-adjacent static; **Astro** for content/SEO sites (recommended — see Project Archetypes)
- Mobile: **Expo + React Native**
- Desktop: **Electron (TS + React)**
- DB: **Managed Postgres** (DO / fly.io / Supabase / Neon) + **Prisma**
- Storage: **Tigris** or native cloud

### Track B: SSR/SEO content platform

Use for course platforms, marketing sites, content-heavy public pages.

- Static content / SEO sites: **Astro** (recommended SSG — see Project Archetypes)
- Frontend (app + SSR): **Next.js 16** (App Router) — see `references/stacks-frontend.md`
- Backend: **Node.js 22 + Fastify 5** — see `references/stacks-backend.md`
- DB: **Postgres** (managed) + Redis for cache/queues
- Auth: **Clerk / Auth0 / NextAuth** depending on enterprise needs

### Track C: Python + Supabase (AI/bots/data)

Use for Telegram bots with admin, AI/RAG projects, data-heavy backends, teams stronger in Python.

- Backend: **Python 3.12 + FastAPI 0.115+** — see `references/stacks-python-supabase.md`
- Bot framework: **aiogram 3.x** or python-telegram-bot v21+
- BaaS: **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Realtime + Edge Functions)
- Frontend: **Next.js 16** (App Router) или **Vite + React**
- ORM: **SQLAlchemy 2.x async** (или SQLModel) с **asyncpg**

For data layer choice across all tracks (Supabase vs Yandex Cloud vs self-hosted), see `references/stacks-data-layer.md`.

### Choosing Between Tracks

| Ask | Track |
|---|---|
| Does public content need to be indexed by Google? | B |
| Is there a course catalog / blog / marketing page? | B |
| Telegram bot + admin panel? | **C** |
| AI/RAG with LLM integration? | **C** |
| Data/ML processing in backend? | **C** |
| Internal authenticated-only tool? | **A** |
| Mobile app (Expo)? | **A** |
| Desktop app (Electron)? | **A** |
| Bot control panel or agent UI (no Python ML)? | **A** |
| 152-ФЗ (RU data residency) required? | **C** + Yandex Cloud (see `stacks-data-layer.md`) |

**Scale defaults for all tracks:** target 10K users initially. No microservices, no Kubernetes before 10K. Managed DB, managed storage, single service.

## AI/LLM Integration Architecture

RAG pipelines, AI tutoring patterns, prompt observability, guardrails, vector DB selection.

## Golden Question Bank (Discovery Phase)

Structured questions for the Discovery phase. Select relevant categories based on project scope.

### Business

1. What is the primary revenue model? (subscription, one-time, cohort-based, B2B licensing)
2. Target user count at launch? In 12 months?
3. Who are the end users? (self-learners, K-12 students, corporate employees, university)
4. What is the competitive differentiator vs Teachable/Udemy/Coursera?
5. Is B2B (selling to institutions) in scope? Timeline?
6. What is the content creation workflow? (solo instructor, team, UGC)
7. Budget for infrastructure? Monthly ceiling?
8. Existing audience/distribution channel?

### Technical

1. Existing codebase/tech stack? Migration constraints?
2. Team size and expertise? (frontend, backend, DevOps, ML)
3. Expected content types? (video, text, interactive, code exercises, quizzes)
4. Integration requirements? (LMS via LTI, CRM, payment providers, analytics)
5. Mobile app needed? Timeline? (responsive web, PWA, native)
6. Expected concurrent users during peak? (live events, launches)
7. Data residency requirements? (EU, US, specific country)
8. Existing infrastructure? (cloud provider, CI/CD, monitoring)

### Pedagogy (EdTech / course products only)

1. What learning model? (self-paced, cohort, live, blended)
2. Assessment types? (quizzes, projects, peer review, AI-graded)
3. Certification/credentialing needed? (certificates, badges, transcripts)
4. Progress tracking granularity? (course, module, lesson, activity)
5. Adaptive learning or fixed curriculum?
6. Instructor-student interaction model? (forum, chat, 1:1, office hours)
7. Content versioning? (update in place, or preserve student's enrolled version)
8. Accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, screen reader, captions)

### Compliance

1. User age range? (adults only, 13+, under 13 -- triggers COPPA)
2. Geographic scope? (US -- FERPA, EU -- GDPR, both)
3. Handling student education records from institutions? (FERPA)
4. Payment card data handling? (PCI DSS scope)
5. Data retention policy requirements?
6. Right to deletion / data portability needed?
7. Audit trail requirements? (who accessed what, when)
8. Third-party data processor agreements needed?

## Deliverables

- Discovery questions (context + constraints) -- use Golden Question Bank
- Options matrix (2-3 approaches with tradeoffs)
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record) -- template: `templates/adr-template.md`
- Phased implementation plan
- Risk register

## Domain examples

Domain-specific concerns to consider when relevant — e.g. for an **EdTech** product:
video delivery, entitlements, instructor workflows, cohort/live learning, progress tracking,
certificates, content moderation, analytics (completion rates, engagement), AI tutoring,
LTI integration, real-time collaboration, agent-operated admin workflows. For other domains
the relevant concerns differ — **e-commerce:** catalog/cart/payments/inventory; **marketplace:**
two-sided matching, trust/reputation, payouts; **SaaS:** billing/seats, multi-tenancy, usage
metering. Map the concerns of whatever domain you are actually building.

| Threat Model | `templates/threat-model.md` | At project start or security review |
| Options Matrix | `templates/options-matrix.md` | When comparing 2+ approaches |

## Adaptive Workflow

### Small task (< 1 day)
1. Context -> 2. Decision -> 3. ADR -> done

### Greenfield project
1. **Discovery** -- constraints, success criteria, budget, timeline.
   Use Golden Question Bank (select relevant categories).
2. **Domain modeling** -- bounded contexts, entities, events. Read `references/architecture.md`
3. **Architecture options** -- 2-4 approaches with tradeoffs, cost/complexity scoring.
   Apply Agent Native checklist. Run Build vs Buy matrix for each component.
4. **Design document** -- stack, DB schema, API, infra. Read relevant `references/stacks-*.md`
5. **Gate** -- user approves or corrects
6. **Implementation plan** -- phases, tickets, dependencies

### Re-architecture / Migration
1. Audit current state (bottlenecks, tech debt, risks)
2. Target architecture (apply Agent Native principles)
3. Migration plan (strangler fig, parallel run, data migration)
4. Risk register
5. Gate: approval

### Incident / Audit
1. Investigation (logs, traces, root cause)
2. Immediate fix
3. Post-mortem + systemic fix
4. Prevention (monitoring, tests, runbook)

## Cost/Complexity Scoring

Before recommending advanced architecture:

| Criterion | Simple (1) | Medium (2) | Complex (3) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Services | 1-2 | 3-5 | 6+ |
| Team | 1-3 | 4-10 | 10+ |
| Data | Single DB | Read replicas | Multi-DB, CQRS |
| Deployment | Single | 2-3 pipelines | K8s + mesh |
| AI/LLM | No AI or basic API calls | RAG pipeline, single model | Multi-model, fine-tuning, evals |
| Real-time | None or SSE | WebSocket chat/presence | CRDT editing + WebRTC |

Score < 6: modular monolith. Score 6-10: extract on pressure. Score > 10: service-oriented.

## Artifacts per Stage

- Discovery: structured questions (from Golden Question Bank), constraints list
- Options: tradeoff matrix, cost/complexity scores, Build vs Buy matrix
  (use `templates/options-matrix.md`)
- Decision: ADR (use `templates/adr-template.md`)
- Plan: phased roadmap with milestones
- Risk: assumptions log, decision log, open questions

## Source Discipline

Authoritative sources (official docs, RFC, OWASP) for recommendations. Blog posts for
supporting context. Community posts (DEV.to, reels) only for discovery, never as basis
for recommendations.
